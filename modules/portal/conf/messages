dataAndPrivacyPolicy.header=EHRI Data and Privacy Policy
dataAndPrivacyPolicy.1=EHRI is committed to the privacy of the users of our websites and we make every effort \
  to safeguard the information collected on this website. EHRI is aware of its responsibility when processing \
  personal data. EHRI wants every person whose personal data it processes to be confident that this is done in \
  a careful and lawful manner. EHRI only processes your personal data if there is a legitimate basis for doing \
  so. EHRI processes personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the privacy \
  rules arising from it. This Policy explains which personal data are collected by EHRI, how these data are processed \
  and for what purpose.
dataAndPrivacyPolicy.2=Please read the following information carefully before using this website. By accessing or \
  using this website, you agree to accept this EHRI Privacy and Data Policy. If you do not agree with any of the \
  terms below, do not access or otherwise use this website.

privacy.header=EHRI Privacy Policy
privacy.users.header=Data from users of this website and its services
privacy.users.1=In order to use a number of the features of the EHRI websites, EHRI requires certain personal data \
  from you such as your name, address, email and professional affiliation. These personal data are provided by you \
  voluntarily and will be treated with care. EHRI only processes personal data if this is necessary for a specific \
  purpose. The purpose determines which personal data have to be processed and no more data will be asked for than \
  is essential for that purpose.
privacy.users.2=For certain categories of website users, a set of personal data is kept, including pages consulted, \
  address data for mailing lists and contact databases. This is necessary to enable the website to operate properly. \
  Certain data are required for statistical purposes and are anonymized. The use of individual personal data is \
  restricted to the purpose for which they were collected and of which the provider thereof is aware). Such data \
  will not be communicated to third parties unless EHRI has  a legal obligation or basis to do so as referred to \
  in article 6 GDPR.
privacy.users.3=When EHRI discloses your data to a third party, it will safeguard your rights to privacy, among \
  other things if applicable by concluding a processing agreement in which arrangements are made as to how your \
  personal data must be dealt with.
privacy.users.4=Users who register on the EHRI Portal and create a profile agree that the personal information \
  they provide about themselves can be made available to other registered portal users and that their name will \
  be published on the portal if they author public content. Registered users are contactable by other registered \
  users and they may receive communications from such users to the email address provided. However, the email \
  address of the recipient of such a communication will not be disclosed to the initiator of the contact and \
  vice versa. Registered users may further opt-out from being contactable by updating their personal profile \
  preferences.
privacy.users.5=EHRI can furthermore process one or more of your personal details for the following purposes \
  (depending on the activities that apply to you):
privacy.users.5.a=to be able to help you and inform you regarding specific research and/or collection issues;
privacy.users.5.b=to communicate with you by sending e-mails;
privacy.users.5.c=to improve our website.
privacy.users.6=Except for the cases listed above, EHRI will not pass on any data of registered users to third \
  parties unless required to by law. If EHRI processes personal data on the basis of your consent, you have the \
  opportunity to withdraw your consent at any time. From that moment on, EHRI will no longer process any of your \
  personal data.

dataPolicy.data.header=Data on the research portal
dataPolicy.data.1=This database might contain special categories of Personal Data and Personal Data regarding to \
  criminal convictions or offences  which according to European and Dutch data protection regulations can be used \
  for research purposes only (article 9, 10 GDPR).
dataPolicy.data.2=Special categories of Personal Data is any data related to an identified or identifiable person \
  related to a person's religion or belief, race, political opinion, health, sexual life, and trade union membership.
dataPolicy.data.3=The research portal contains descriptions of Holocaust-related collections and sources kept in \
  collection-holding institutions (archives, documentation centers) in Europe, the USA and Israel. These collection \
  descriptions may include special categories of Personal Data and Personal Data regarding to criminal convictions or \
  offences. Since the processing and publication of these data may have implications from the perspective of data \
  protection, EHRI has conducted a risk assessment to determine whether these data can be accessed via the research \
  portal and the websites of EHRI. EHRI decided that, taking into account European (GDPR) and national personal data \
  protection regulations, the nature of the collection descriptions, archival practice and the privacy policies of the \
  collection-holding institutions, publishing these collection descriptions (and not the collections itself) does not \
  constitute a major data protection risk. As a consequence, access to the collection descriptions and all the other \
  information on the research portal is open to users.
dataPolicy.data.4=Under article 9 and 10  GDPR, special categories of Personal Data and Personal Data regarding to \
  criminal convictions or offences  can only be used for research purposes. Responsibility for compliance with the \
  European and Dutch personal data protection regulations lies with the person ultimately publishing the data. When \
  research results are published in a country other than the Netherlands, the personal data protection act of that \
  country must be complied with. Where research results are published in a country other than bound by the GDPR, the \
  personal data protection act of that country must be complied with. Since the data on the research portal only \
  involve descriptions of collections (and not the collections itself), a visit to the archive storing the records \
  is necessary to actually access the documents. It is quite likely that this institution will have its own data \
  protection policy regarding access to the sources and privacy protection: this is explained in the detailed version \
  of the country reports. Users have to comply with these specific procedures and cannot invoke the fact that they \
  found a collection description on the EHRI research portal to gain access to the archived document itself.
dataPolicy.data.5=If you consider you have well-founded grounds - based on the GDPR and/or Dutch personal data \
  protection regulation - against the publication of a specific set of personal data on the research portal, you \
  may send a letter or an email, indicating your interest and explaining your reasons for objecting to publication, \
  to the party responsible for processing the personal data. This party will examine your complaint and provide you \
  with an answer within a reasonable space of time.

# About page
#
about.heading=About EHRI
about.p1=The EHRI online portal provides access to information about Holocaust-related \
  archival materials held in institutions across Europe and beyond. \
  The EHRI portal can be accessed by anyone free of charge.
about.p2=The EHRI portal seeks to overcome one of the hallmark challenges of Holocaust research: \
  the fragmentation and wide geographic dispersal of archival sources documenting the event. \
  By integrating and interconnecting information on tens of thousands of archival sources physically \
  held in hundreds of institutions, the EHRI portal is an invaluable resource for anybody interested \
  in the Holocaust, and enables new transnational and comparative approaches to research.
about.p3=The EHRI portal is one of the main outcomes of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure \
  (EHRI) project, a consortium bringing together Holocaust researchers, archivists and digital humanists \
  from more than 20 institutions. \
  The EHRI portal is an expanding resource and new information and features are continuously added.
about.p4=EHRI is both a digital infrastructure and a human network. In addition to creating the portal, \
  the EHRI project has also developed a free-to-use {0}, and hosts a \
  varied programme of activities and events including a Fellowship programme, Summer Schools, \
  expert workshops and conferences. More information on the project''s background, contributing \
  institutions and activities is available on the {1}.
about.p4.a1=Online Course on Holocaust Studies
about.p4.a2=project website
about.p5=The EHRI project has received funding from the European Union''s Seventh Framework Programme under grant \
 agreement No 261873, and from the European Union''s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under \
 grant agreement No 654164.
